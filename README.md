## Description:
This project involves setting up a Python web server that retrieves data from the ATmega8 microcontroller and displays it on a web page.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- ATmega8 microcontroller
- Web browser

## Installation:
1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.
3. Connect the ATmega8 microcontroller to your computer and ensure it is properly configured to communicate with Python.

## Usage:
